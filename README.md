# jira-canned-responses

This plugin will help you to add canned responses to jira comments or description text areas. These responses are helpful in many cases
such as story templates, review templates etc.

## How to get it

Coming soon

## What is it

The extension adds a little button inside jira comments/text areas, that allows you to choose one of the existing canned responses, and insert it in the current comment.


#### Usage on comments

## Adding your own canned responses

The extension comes with a few default canned responses, but you can edit them and add your own! In the dropdown, press the edit link, and there you can add more canned responses and also change the auto comment option on/off. The edit functionality will not be present when you are on a modal inside jira.
